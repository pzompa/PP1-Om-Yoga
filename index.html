                <p>"Om Yoga is a joyful expression of life! It is about the dance between mind, body, and spirit. I feel at home at Sonic because I am free to express my natural energy, 
                    whatever it may be that day, without fear of judgment. And it is always a spiritual up-lifter, too.."

They are open to whereever you may be at in your personal yoga practice, AND there is truly a class for everyone."
